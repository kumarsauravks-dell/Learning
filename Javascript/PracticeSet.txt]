Practice Set 1
1. Create a variable of type string and try to add a number to it.

    }
    obj=4; // it will throw as error because we can not reassign any variable with const declaration
4. Try to add a new key to the const object in Q3. Were you able to do it?
Sol.
    const obj={
        name:"Kumar",
        age:21,

        Aakash:75
    }
    for(let i=0;i<Object.keys(marks).length;i++){
        console.log("Marks of "+Object.keys(marks)[i]+ " is "+ marks[Object.keys(marks)[i]])
    }
2. WAP for Q1 using for in loop
Sol.
    let marks={
        Harry:98,
        Rohan:70,
        Aakash:75
    }
    for(let key in marks){
        console.log("Marks of "+key+ " is "+ marks[key])
    }
3. WAP to print "Try Again" until the user enters the correct number.
Sol.
    let correctNum=4;
    let num;
    while(num!==correctNum){

        num=Number.parseInt(prompt("Please Enter a number"));
    }
    console.log("You have entered correct number.")

Sol.
    const calculateMean=(a,b,c,d)=>{
        return (a+b+c+d)/4
    }
    let mean=calculateMean(2,3,4,6)
    console.log(mean);

Practice Set 4
1. What will the following line print ? console.log("har\"".length)
Sol.
    console.log("har\"".length) //4 as the /" is treated as one escape sequence character.
2. Explore the includes, startsWith & endsWith function of a string.
Sol. 
    let str="Black fox hiding around the bush";
